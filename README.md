# 🔥 Wildfire Risk Prediction System

This project predicts wildfire risk using environmental data such as
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and smoke levels.

The system currently uses simulated and historical data and is designed
to later integrate real-time sensor data (e.g., Arduino).

## Features
- Simulated environmental data
- Rule-based wildfire risk prediction
- Extendable to machine learning models

## Technologies
- Python
- GitHub
